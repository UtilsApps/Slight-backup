Slight backup android program

Copyright (c) 2011-2014 Stefan Handschuh

The file "LICENSE" contains the license information for the program.


This small program allows you to backup and restore specific data of your
android device:
 * SMS (only if the standard application is used; complicated for android 4.4 and likely above)
 * Call-logs (no voicemails)
 * Settings (experimental)
 * Bookmarks (only stock browser; no folders are supported)
 * Playlists
 * User dictionaries
 * Contacts (experimental, see below)

The backups are stored unencrypted in an editable location (standard: sdcard).


Contacts import/ export
=======================

The contacts import and export is performed via the android internal vcs
capabilities.

For exporting contacts, Slight backup just tells the underlying android api to
create the vcs text for each contact. Afterwards the individual strings are
getting bundled into a single xml file.

Importing contacts is slightly more complicated. In a first phase, the program
gathers information about the currently available contacts in order to avoid
duplicates. Then the vcs strings of the detected to be non-existent contacts are
put together into one single vcs file which will be sent to the android api for
import.

Since the vcs texts do not contain information about the "starred" property of a
certain contact, this property will *not* be restored during the import.


SMS import for android >= 4.4
=============================

In android 4.4, an official public SMS api has been introduced. This new api only
allows the standard messaging application to write to the SMS database. Therefore,
if one wants to import SMS, Slight backup has to be the standard messaging
application. In order to be recognized as a possible standard messaging application,
several functionalities have to be provided such as receiving SMS. Slight backup
however only defines dummy receivers for SMS to fulfill the minimal requirements
theoretically. Slight backup IS NOT ABLE TO PROCESS RECEIVED MESSAGES SUCH THAT
THEY WILL BE LOST IF THEY ARE RECEIVED WHILE Slight backup IS THE STANDARD
MESSAGING APPLICATION.

Therefore, the following procedure might be a solution to this problem:
  1. enable airplane mode such that messages won't be received
  2. set Slight backup as the default messaging application
  3. import SMS
  4. change the default messaging application back to its original value
  5. disable airplane mode
This however, is also not a secure solution since the meaning of airplane mode
might change.
